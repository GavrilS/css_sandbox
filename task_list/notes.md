* Make your table markup as simple as possible, and keep things flexible, e.g. by using percentages, so the design is more responsive.
* Use table-layout: fixed to create a more predictable table layout that allows you to easily set column widths by setting width on their headings (<th>).
* Use border-collapse: collapse to make table elements borders collapse into each other, producing a neater and easier to control look.
* Use <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> to break up your table into logical chunks and provide extra places to apply CSS to, so it is easier to layer styles on top of one another if required.
* Use zebra striping to make alternative rows easier to read.
* Use text-align to line up your <th> and <td> text, to make things neater and easier to follow.
